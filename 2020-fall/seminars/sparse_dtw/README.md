# sparseDTW
Python Implementation of the SparseDTW Algorithm by Ghazi Al-Naymat, 
Sanjay Chawla and Javid Taheri.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2969

It's usable as a cli tool, by feeding it 2 file paths and an optional
resistance parameter. 

Uses `scipy.sparse.lil_matrix` and implemented simple backtracking.
