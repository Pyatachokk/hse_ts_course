When it comes to building a classification algorithm, analysts have a broad range of open source options to choose from. However, for time series classification, there are less out-of-the box solutions.

I began researching the domain of time series classification and was intrigued by a recommended technique called K Nearest Neighbors and Dynamic Time Warping. A meta analysis completed by Mitsa (2010) suggests that when it comes to timeseries classification, 1 Nearest Neighbor (K=1) and Dynamic Timewarping is very difficult to beat [1].

This repo contains a python implementation ([and IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/markdregan/K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Dynamic-Time-Warping/blob/master/K_Nearest_Neighbor_Dynamic_Time_Warping.ipynb)) of KNN & DTW classification algorithm.

The following [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/markdregan/K-Nearest-Neighbors-with-Dynamic-Time-Warping/blob/master/K_Nearest_Neighbor_Dynamic_Time_Warping.ipynb) evaluates the KNN and DTW classifer by using it to classify human activities (sitting, walking, lying) when given timeseries data from a smart phones gyroscope and accelerometer (HAR dataset).

#### Human Activity Recognition Dataset
The Human Activity Recognition Dataset (HAR) dataset is chosen to test the classification performance of DTW & KNN [3].

> The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
